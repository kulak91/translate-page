                "Nearshore software development services are the type of outsourcing provided within an insignificant distance and time zone difference (usually up to 3 hours). It still can be more cost-effective than hiring developers in your country where you have to cover all the administrative processes and have a limited pool of candidates to choose from.",

                "Nearshore software development can provide you with access to a wider range of technical talent without the inconveniences of cultural gaps and significant time zone differences. While it’s a cost-effective solution that handles the hiring and all other HR processes for you, it also allows you to have direct communication within your working hours. Various companies can benefit from nearshore software development, especially when they’re looking for fast team scaling and budget flexibility.",

              answer:
                "Offshore development services imply outsourcing your IT needs to a company located far from you, for the sake of cost savings and access to more specialists that might have the right expertise in your niche. In its turn, nearshore software development services mean outsourcing to a company that is located in relative proximity. For instance, when a company headquartered in New York partners with our software developers in Lviv (6-hour difference), it’s a case of offshore outsourcing. But when we cooperate with European businesses, for example, a Swedish-based one (1-hour difference), it’s a classical case of nearshore development.",

              answer:
                "Just like with other types of software outsourcing, you can hire separate nearshore developers to cover your needs on a running project, find a team that will be integrated into your internal team, or build a dedicated team that will be devoted to your product from start to finish.",

          title: "Reasons to choose nearshore software development services",
          text: "Choosing nearshore development might be the optimal choice for your business for a number of reasons:\n### Broader access to tech talent\nNearshore software development is a type of outsourcing that allows you to choose from the top engineers experienced in any niche and technology. While you’re very limited in your choice when hiring locally, nearshore outsourcing offers not only more tech talents but also lower hourly rates. Plus, a nearshore provider will handle all the administrative processes for you.\n### Convenient location\nPartnering with Binary Studio, you’ll be able to directly communicate with the team without time zone discrepancies and even easily get to their location if needed. While insignificant distance is a benefit in itself, it also means that nearshore developers are likely to operate under similar laws and regulations (especially in the EU context). \n### Quick start and team scaling\nA nearshore software development firm will allow you to quickly build a whole team or hire the right IT specialists for any type of project. Without having to deal with hiring yourself, you’ll get experienced engineers ready to kick off the development process in a matter of a few weeks. You’ll also be able to flexibly scale the team over time according to your needs.\n### Budget-friendly development\nBy choosing nearshore development services for your business, you can achieve your goals at relatively low rates. A variety of providers will give you the opportunity to choose the best nearshore software development company based on experience and budget estimates for your project. \n### No cultural gap\nWith a nearshore development team, you can be sure that there are no language and cultural barriers in the processes. Working with people who live within a similar culture, you’ll understand each other better and have higher chances of building long-lasting relations, which is essential for complex projects meant for future scaling and improvement. \n### Cooperation flexibility\nIn comparison to having an internal team that you’ll need to maintain and support, you can choose different models of cooperation with a nearshore provider, and even change them when needed. For instance, you might hire several developers to cover some tasks, then build a whole team for full-fledged development and testing, and then continue with a few specialists at the post-release stage.\n",
